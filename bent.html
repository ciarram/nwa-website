                <h4>Origins of Bentonville</h4>
                <p class="topFacts">The city of Bentonville came originally from Benton County, the first established county after Arkansas became a state in 1836. The city has long been an area for economic growth. Their early production of apples soon gave way to poultry and dairy, some of the basis for their current economy. Bentonville made a name for itself when Sam Walton opened his store in 1950. Originally called Walton's 5-10 store, today it's better known as Walmart. This brought a lot of growth to the town over the past 70 years, and with it the economic prosperity. Today, Bentonville has grown from a small town to a growing city with a rich arts scene.</p>

                    <h3>Bentonville Historic Square</h3>
                    <img src="images/bentonville_square.jpg" class="leftPic">
                    <p>The downtown Bentonville square began as the center of the town and is still a lively focal point for the growing city. The sqaure was designed so that the rest of the city grew around it. The county courthouse, an opera house, and the original Walmart, called Walton's 5-10 store, all occupied spots on the square in the early days. The opera house was eventually torn down but the courthouse remains. Walton's 5-10 store was converted into a museum to show the evolution of Walmart. The sqaure today still is an active area of commerce in Bentonville. There are a variety of shops, restuarants and coffee houses that are frequented every day, signifying that the square's relevance is still strong no matter how large the city grows.</p>

                    <h3>Crystal Bridges</h3>
                    <img src="images/crystal_home2.jpeg" class="rightPic">
                    <p>This newer addition to Northwest Arkansas puts a spotlight on the growing arts scene in the area. Opened in 2011, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art shows the evolution of American arts from the days of the 13 colonies to modern American artists. The museum was designed to highlight the natural beauty of the land it was built on and to blend as naturally with the landscape as possible. One special item the museum has is the Frank Lloyd Wright house. The house was shipped from New Jersey piece by piece and fully rebuild with the labeled pieces on the grounds of the museum. Crystal Bridges has a large perminant exhibit of American artists that are free for visitors to view. In addition, they offer several temporary exhibits througout the year, for a small fee, to explore as well. Those have varied from highlighting specific artists, from Norman Rockwell, John Audubon and Georgia O'Keeffe, to having multiple artists whose work revolves around a specific theme. In the past, those have included Picturing the Americas, The Open Road, Art for a New Understanding and Men of Steel, Women of Wonder.</p>
