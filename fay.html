            <h4>Origins of Fayetteville</h4>
            <p>The city of Fayetteville was originally settled in 1828 under the name Washington Courthouse. It was renamed Fayetteville in 1829 and retains the name to this day. The city was officially incorporated in 1841, five years after Arkansas became a state in 1836. Ever since then, the town had kept growing.</p>
