                <h4>Origins of Fayetteville</h4>
                <p class="topFacts">The city of Fayetteville was originally settled in 1828 under the name Washington Courthouse. It was renamed Fayetteville in 1829 and retains the name to this day. The city was officially incorporated in 1841, five years after Arkansas became a state in 1836. Ever since then, the town had kept growing. It has the atmosphere of a college town, which has only kept growing as the University has gotten bigger. Despite that, Fayetteville still has a strong community sense about it. Rated as one of the top places to live in the United States, Fayetteville has a growing arts scene, annual festivals and will turn out to call the Hogs for any of the collegiate sports throughout the year.</p>

                    <h3>University of Arkansas</h3>
                    <img src="images/old_main.jpg" class="leftPic">
                    <p>The University of Arkansas was founded in 1871. There was a bidding war between three towns to provide the land and money to build the university. Fayetteville won in the end. The most notable building on the campus is Old Main. Finished in 1875, it was one of the main buildings where classes were originally taught and is sometimes called the "mother" of the campus. The campus has steadily grown since it's founding and now has a population of over 27,000 students as of Fall 2019. Its mascot, the Razorback, serves as a rally cry for the sports teams the University hosts including gymnastics, track and field, baseball, basketball and, since we are in the South, football.</p>

                    <img src="images/dickson_street.jpg" class="rightPic">
                    <p>If there's one street in Fayetteville you can just say by one name and everyone knows immediately where and what it is, it's Dickson Street. As you leave the west side of the University campus, you encounter a street that stretches down over a mile. Dickson Street was one of the original streets in Fayetteville, dating back to the 1840s. Many of the businesss on Dickson are housed in buildings from the 1800s. Many businesses have been on Dickson for decades and are institutions: George's Majestic Lounge, Collier's Drug Store and Dickson Street Bookshop to name a few. The addition of the Walton Arts Center helped to revitalize the street in the early 1990s and the street is center to many anual celebrations in Fayetteville.</p>
