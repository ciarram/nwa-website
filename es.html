            <h4>Origins of Eureka Springs</h4>
            <p>Eureka Springs is a small town with a big history. The town was officially founded in 1879, but the area was discovered in 1856. The original business endevors that came from the town sprang, pun not intended, from the natural springs that had been used since the Native Americans were the primary inhabitants of the area. They were known as healing springs and the springs can still be seen in the town. Eureka Springs has weathered economic ups and downs for over 100 years and is now known as a small tourist hotspot. The town is nestled deep in the hills of Northwest Arkansas, and not a place you would want to get stuck trying to get to on a bad winter day. But, the views and landscape add to the special quality that makes Eureka Springs quirky and unique.</p>

            <h3>Historic Downtown Eureka Springs</h3>
            <p>When locals think about Eureka Springs, one of the first things to pop into their minds is the historic downtown. When you drive your car into the entrance of downtown, you almost feel like you're stepping back in time. The only difference is that modern cars have replaced horses and carriages (and of course there is electricity and air conditioning). Downtown Eureka Springs has retained the vestages of its Victorian architecture. Nestled into the buildings are shops and restuarants, some of which have been there for decades. There is a trolley tour that takes visitors around the downtown area and through the hills to look at the Victorian design and gives a great history about the town. You can walk on the sidewalks and drive on the roads that haven't been changed too much since the town was founded in the late 1800s. Just watch your step!</p>

Founded in 1886 and build out of limestone that is the bedrock of Northwest Arkansas, the Cresent Hotel and Spa sits on a hill overlooking downtown Eureka Springs. The hotel has 72 rooms that a visitor could stay in or if you are just in town for the day, you can look around the hotel lobby and its garden areas.

            <h3>Thorncrown Chapel</h3>
            <p>It's not surprising that buildings in Northwest Arkansas would be designed to take advantage of the beautiful landscape. That was taken seriously when Thorncrown Chapel was designed and opened in 1980. The chapel was designed by Fay Jones, a local architect who studied under Frank Lloyd Wright. It's compsied of wood, local stone and glass everywhere. The chapel has an unencumbered view from the hill that it sits on. It is an active church and holds services on Sundays. The rest of the week, it is open for people to come in and look around. You can even hear a guide tell about the history of the chapel. It's also no surprise that the chapel is an extremely popular venue for weddings.</p>
